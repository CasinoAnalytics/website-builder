Previously, we had announced the first Meetup would be on June 20, but weren't sure where. We are happy to say that the [InNEVation Center, Powered by Switch](https://www.innevation.com/) has agreed to host us. The agenda will remain the same: an intro to the group and an introduction to Python and R for data analysis, especially for Excel users.

We'll start at 6:30, and there will be free food. There is no charge to attend, or reservations required, so we hope you'll bring a colleague along.

The InNEVation Center is located off the 215 [between Decatur and Jones](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Innevation+Center/@36.0665333,-115.2192654,15.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4f1c35e8f68b2e74!8m2!3d36.0666193!4d-115.2136257).
